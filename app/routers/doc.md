## Sample Markdown Text

This is a sample document to showcase some markdown formatting.

**Bold Text:** This text is bolded for emphasis. You can achieve bold formatting with either two asterisks (`**text**`) or two underscores (`__text__`) surrounding the text.

*Italic Text*: This text is italicized for emphasis. Use asterisks (`*text*`) or underscores (`_text_`) to italicize.

**Combining Bold and Italics:** You can use three asterisks (`***text***`) to make text both bold and italic. 

Here's a table with some data and links:

| Feature | Description | Link |
|---|---|---|
| **Markdown Guide** | A website reference for markdown syntax. | [Markdown Guide] |
| *Table Formatting* | Explains markdown table syntax. | [Markdown Guide](#table-formatting) |
| _Emphasis with Italics_ | Explains how to italicize text. | [Markdown Guide](#emphasis) |

**Note:** In this example, the second and third links in the table point to the same resource, [Markdown Guide], but link to a specific section within the guide using descriptive text and anchor tags.
